\label{sec:implementation}

To illustrate the functionality of our system, we presented a generic security model for a company in \Cref{sec:hybird_istantiation}. Following this, in \Cref{sec:implementation.prolog}, we suggest a potential implementation in Prolog for certain components of the hybrid model. In \Cref{sec:implementation.prolog}, we provide a practical example that involves an administrator invoking some state-change rules. Lastly, in \Cref{sec:implementation.advanced}, we analyze the costs of our proposal.
