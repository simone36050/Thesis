\chapter{The Proposed Hybrid Scheme}
\label{sec:hybrid}

This chapter describes the design and the components of our \hybrid. In \Cref{sec:hybrid.structure} we provide an overview of our \hybrid, in \Cref{sec:hybrid.scheme} we describe the \erbac, and in \Cref{sec:hybrid.cac} we describe the \cac modified according to our \erbac. %, and in \Cref{sec:hybird_istantiation} we provide an example an istantiation of our extended model.

% \stefanonote{In this section, when we present our extended AC scheme, I would also add a paragraph discussing the difference of our extended AC scheme with ABAC (see below in \LaTeX our previous comments on this) \simonenote{see \Cref{note:abac}}}
