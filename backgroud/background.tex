\chapter{Background}
\label{sec:background}

This chapter explains the concepts of \gls{ac} and \gls{cac}. \Cref{sec:background.access_control} provides a definition of \gls{ac} and explains the \gls{rbac} model in details. \Cref{sec:background.cac} introduces the concept of \gls{cac} and describes how \gls{cac} may be used as an enforcement mechanism for \gls{rbac} by presenting the operations of the \gls{cac} scheme in \cite{cac}, which is one of the bases of our work.
